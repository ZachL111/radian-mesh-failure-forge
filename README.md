# radian-mesh-failure-forge

`radian-mesh-failure-forge` is a SQL project for Distributed systems. It turns implement an SQL distributed systems project for failure resource planning, using capacity fixtures and allocation and spill reports into a small local model with readable fixtures and a direct verification command.

## Reading Radian Mesh Failure Forge

Start with the README, then open `metadata/project.json` to check the constants behind the examples. After that, `fixtures/cases.csv` shows the compact path and `examples/extended_cases.csv` gives a wider look at the same rule.

## Design Sketch

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The SQL project uses sqlite fixtures, views, and assertions to keep query behavior inspectable.

## Purpose

The goal is to capture the core behavior in code and make the surrounding assumptions obvious. A reader should be able to run the verifier, open the fixtures, and understand why each decision was made.

## What It Does

- Uses fixture data to keep quorum behavior changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for lease timing, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents message ordering tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Fixture Notes

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Files Worth Reading

- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands
- `schema.sql`: sqlite schema and view definitions

## Setup

Clone the repository, enter the directory, and run the verifier. No database server, cloud account, or token is required.

## Usage

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Verification

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Limits

This code is local-first. It makes no claim about deployed usage and avoids credentials, hosted state, and environment-specific setup.

## Next Directions

- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add one more distributed systems fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
